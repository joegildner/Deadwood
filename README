Deadwood
CSCI 347 Winter 2019
Aran Clauson

We worked on this project using peer programming. Melody was on point for the model and resource handling,
and Joe was point for the Controllers and Views, with some variations. 

To run:
java Deadwood [num players]


To play:
To move from room to room, you must click in the middle(ish) of the room name of the room you wish to go to. 
To commit to a role, simply click on the role icon.
To upgrade in the office, simpy click on the dollar/credit amount for the rank you wish to upgrade to.
To act for a role, click the "Act" button in the lower left of the screen.
To rehearse for a role, click the "Rehearse" button in the lower left of the screen.
To end* your turn, click the "End" button in the lower left of the screen.



*For testing purposes, we are trusting the final end-user to not do more actions on their 
turn than allowed by the game rules. We did not want to have to run through an entire game
the real way just to test if something worked, so we thought we should extend that benefit
to you.
